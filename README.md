# toybox

A collection of small toy programs

## `bfdbg`

`bfdbg` is a brainfuck interpreter and debugger.

## `neuralnets`

`neuralnets` is where I play around with implementing neural network concepts from scratch in python.

## `control`

`control` has scripts that I use to play around with control system topics. Right now it just has a script that runs a kalman filter, but more stuff will be added soon :)

## `rust`

`rust` has all the small programs that I'm writing to teach myself rust. The most notable one is a brainfuck interpreter.

## `archive`

`archive` contains old programs that aren't very representative of how I program now, but I want to keep around :)
