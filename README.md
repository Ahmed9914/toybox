A collection of small toy programs

## `control`

`control` has scripts that I use to play around with control system topics. This includes a simulation of a kalman filter, and a couple system models.

`rendering` has some experiments in 3d rendering, written in python and rust.

## `bfdbg`

`bfdbg` is a brainfuck interpreter and debugger.

## `rust`

`rust` has all the small programs that I'm writing to teach myself rust. The most notable one is a brainfuck interpreter.

## `archive`

`archive` contains old programs that aren't very representative of how I program now, but I want to keep around :)
